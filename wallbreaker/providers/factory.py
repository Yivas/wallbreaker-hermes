    at the tool-invocation boundary — a provider reused across the call (e.g. best_of_n's
    single `target` reused for all N fires) stays pooled for the whole call and is closed
    once at the end, not per model call. Fake-tolerant: monkeypatched build_provider fakes
    replace this function entirely, so they aren't tracked and hold no real client to
    leak; the close loop uses getattr(aclose) so any tracked provider missing aclose is
    skipped rather than raising.
